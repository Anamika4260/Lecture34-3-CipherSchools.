The trees are designed in a way that they self-balance once the height difference exceeds 1. Binary Search Trees use rotations as self-balancing algorithms. There are four different types of rotations: Left Left, Right Right, Left Right, Right Left.

There are various types of self-balancing binary search trees âˆ’

AVL Trees

Red Black Trees

B Trees

B+ Trees

Splay Trees

Priority Search Trees
